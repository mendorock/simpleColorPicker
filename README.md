I discovered an image and, since there wasn't any code associated with it, I decided to create my own HTML, JavaScript, and CSS implementation. Enjoy!

<img src="/img/sample1.png" alt="Sample 1"/>
<img src="/img/sample2.png" alt="Sample 2"/>

Tested in Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Edge (Not Safari yet).
